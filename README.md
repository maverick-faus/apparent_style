This work presents a model based on Deep Neural Networks to predict apparent style using the Seven Universal Styles model from an image. This model is one of the most widely accepted models for evaluating apparent style. This theoretical base has served several professions related to communication, whose purpose is to ensure the coherent transmission of information is beneficial when considering the class of individuals or companies and their interaction with their audience. We propose several models using Deep Learning to automatically extract features from full-body pictures that are indicators of the traits that define the style in apparel subject. Of the presented models, the best one is the model based on XCEPTION, which obtains a 98.27\% accuracy. Compared to the State of the Art, we improve the performance of the dramatic, elegant and magnetic styles that are the only ones available in the literature
